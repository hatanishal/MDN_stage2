Coding Assignment for Stage 2 Application
A HABIT TRACKER

A few notes:
- First time I ever tried to do a time-complexity analysis, so mistakes might be there
- Reading from the config.txt file is still buggy when there is multiple items to track, if it does not read, setting SETUP_CHECK to False will reset everything
  

Files:
#
- src/main.py = The main script that runs the interactive menu that the user will be using
- src/objects.py = The definitions of the custom classes
- src/common.py = A common file for all the functions that is needed for the application's functionality
- src/config.txt = A text file that contains the user
